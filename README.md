# Emotion Detection in Text - CS4641 Machine Learning, Spring 2024

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Spring 2024 CS4641 Machine Learning course at Georgia Tech. It focuses on detecting emotions from Twitter messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Our goal was to classify text into six fundamental emotions: sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise.

## Objectives
- To implement and evaluate various machine learning models for their effectiveness in classifying emotions from text.
- To compare the performance of Naive Bayes, SVM, and BERT models within the context of NLP.
- To understand the trade-offs involved with each model in terms of accuracy, training efficiency, and real-world applicability.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of English Twitter messages, each tagged with one of six emotions: sadness (0), joy (1), love (2), anger (3), fear (4), and surprise (5).
